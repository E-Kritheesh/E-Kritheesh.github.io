Hi! My name is [Kritheesh](https://e-kritheesh.github.io). I am a fourth year undergraduate student in the Department of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). 

I am currently (mid 2023) interested in computer architecture security and embedded systems programming (and all things electrical!).

I am working with [Prof. Biswa](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) exploring the offensive side of architecture attacks and trying to create stealthier and more agile cache attacks. I'm also a part of the research group [CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/).
